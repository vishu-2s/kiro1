# Archived Spec: multi-agent-security

**Archived Date**: 2025-12-04 17:36:14

**Reason**: Superseded by hybrid-agentic-architecture spec

## Why Archived?

This spec represented the first iteration of the multi-agent system. It was replaced by the more comprehensive `hybrid-agentic-architecture` spec which combines:
- Rule-based detection (fast, deterministic)
- Multi-agent analysis (intelligent, adaptive)

The hybrid approach is what's actually implemented in the current system.

## Historical Value

This spec is kept for historical reference and to understand the evolution of the system architecture.

## Current System
